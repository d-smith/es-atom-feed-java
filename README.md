Sample atom feed

This is a simplified version of es-atom-feed-pub used to show how to
package a java web app in a container. 

The initial cut is quick and dirty to show there's really nothing 
special about packaging a java application. This is not an example
of how to use spring to build a web app (needs some work).


Some gradle commands
